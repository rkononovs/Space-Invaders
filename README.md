# Space-Invaders

My coursework for my module: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming C++.

This program implements a basic Object Oriented Programming approach by recreating well-known game Space Invaders.

This game uses SFML library that was used to render graphics, play sounds and overall make game playable in the console window.
